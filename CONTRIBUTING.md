# Contirubtion Notes

1. Create an issue of what you are working on, assign it to yourself if appropriate
2. Create a branch of Master and do your changes in that branch
3. Test your code... (not in production)
4. Push your branch to the repo
5. Create a merge request and assign to Garrett for him to review and then merge
6. Close issue when done!

**Note:** Branch you code, don't commit direct to Master, pushes to Master result in immediate build/deploy. Don't break the app!
